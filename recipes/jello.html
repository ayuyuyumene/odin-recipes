        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Coffee jelly is quite simple to make and there are many different ways of serving it. One common way of serving it is to make the jelly in a glass and top with cream once the jelly is set</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6g gelatine powder</li>
            <li>60ml cold water</li>
            <li>250ml strong hot coffee</li>
            <li>150ml cream</li>
            <li>10g sugar</li>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the cold water to a small container and sprinkle the gelatine and soak in it for about 5 minutes until the gelatine becomes soft and spongy.</li>
            <li>Add the gelatine to the hot coffee and mix well ensuring that gelatine is dissolved and there are no gelatine lumps.</li>
            <li>Pour the coffee mixture into 2 or 3 short glasses and chill them in the fridge for minimum 3 hours.</li>
            <li>While waiting the jelly is in the fridge to set, add cream and sugar in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Whip the cream until it thickens only slightly to a consistency a bit thinner than cream soup.</li>
            <li>When the coffee jelly is set, pour sweet thickened cream over the jelly, decorate with your choice of decoration if using.</li>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Its light, fluffy, moist and less sweet than any other cheesecakes.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>250g cream chesee</li>
            <li>60g butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>The meringue needs to have a soft peak. Do not beat the meringue too much and form a hard peak. When you make a peak in the bowl by lifting the whisker, the peak should slightly bend.</li>
            <li>Bake at low temperature for a long time. Initially bake at 160C (320F) for 20 minutes, then at 140C (284F) for 40 minutes. </li>
            <li>Bake in a water bath. When baking for a long time, the cake tends to dry up. The water bath keeps the cake moist.</li>
            <li>Lay an extra baking pan underneath the water bath. Along with the 2nd point above, this is also a tip to prevent cracking the surface.</li>
            <li>After turning off the oven, leave the cake in for 30 minutes, then gradually cool down with the oven door open for another 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
